# LRUCache

Basic premise is to create an API for a LRU cache (size 3000) that works in O(1) ... constant time.  

Will create a simple API - initially one get for the cache itself, possibly adding other API paths to get/reset cache stats, TBD how that looks.  

LRU cache will use a map as that remebers ordering - this is a kin to a python OrderedDict.  

Let's get started and see how it ends up.
